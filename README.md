This is a faux one-page/scrolling blog and portfolio theme for the [Harp](http://harpjs.com) server and static site generator. It's built with [Jade](http://jade-lang.com) and [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus), and includes very basic [Disqus](https://disqus.com), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com), [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io), and [Formspree](http://formspree.io) integration. You can view it [here](https://n400.github.io/whowhat).

This is not finished yet, but it works and might be helpful for other beginners who are looking for examples of how to hook things up.

The source files are in _workblog. The rest are just the compiled static files that you can delete or ignore.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/n400/whowhat.git
$ cd workblog/_workblog
$ npm install
$ gulp
```
You should then get an external IP address for enjoying synchronized browsing and live reload across devices and browsers. Or you can just visit localhost:3000.

You can find lots of useful documentation and tutorials on the [harpjs website](http://harpjs.com/docs/).
